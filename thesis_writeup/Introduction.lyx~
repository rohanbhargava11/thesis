Navigation ,Localization and SLAM have been the buzz words in the robotics
 for quite a long time.
 There are various algorithms which cater to these systems.
 They have been extensively researched in robotics field.
 With the help of these techniques robot can localize itself in a mapped
 environment.All the these algorithms are based on models which describe
 the motion and the sensors of the robot.
 Generally these models are hand tuned by experts based on their experience
 and it can be a tedious process.
 As we are moving head in our goal of making robots a ubiquitous part our
 everyday life they need to adapt to the dynamic environment.
 The motion model can change due to environment and terrain changes and
 from general wear on the robot.

In AUV the density and the temperature of the water can lead to changes
 in the motion model.
 These models need to be adapted as algorithms like navigation running on
 top of them are highly dependant on accuracy of these models.
 We wanted an online system so that AUV can adapt its motion model which
 in-turn can help us in not loosing accuracy in navigation.
 In this paper we present a method to adapt our motion model to the changing
 environment.
 We use features in the surface bed to gather information about the position
 of the AUV.

The position estimates are fed into Expectation Maximization framework which
 is able to learn the parameters of the model.
 Current SLAM techniques do the same but we need to revisit places over
 time so that the features are matched.
 In our approach we are attempting to reduce the localization error without
 building a map or revisiting places.

For my master's thesis we looked at mobile robot online calibration problem
 and specifically dealt with underwater robots and their sensors.
 In the next chapters we address the problem and describe our solution.
