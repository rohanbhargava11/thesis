@article{Dehaene1998,
abstract = {A minimal hypothesis is proposed concerning the brain processes underlying effortful tasks. It distinguishes two main computational spaces: a unique global workspace composed of distributed and heavily interconnected neurons with long-range axons, and a set of specialized and modular perceptual, motor, memory, evaluative, and attentional processors. Workspace neurons are mobilized in effortful tasks for which the specialized processors do not suffice. They selectively mobilize or suppress, through descending connections, the contribution of specific processor neurons. In the course of task performance, workspace neurons become spontaneously coactivated, forming discrete though variable spatio-temporal patterns subject to modulation by vigilance signals and to selection by reward signals. A computer simulation of the Stroop task shows workspace activation to increase during acquisition of a novel task, effortful execution, and after errors. We outline predictions for spatio-temporal activation patterns during brain imaging, particularly about the contribution of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate to the workspace.},

abstract = {Models are among the most essential tools in robotics, such as kinematics and dynamics models of the robot's own body and controllable external objects. It is widely believed that intelligent mammals also rely on internal models in order to generate their actions. However, while classical robotics relies on manually generated models that are based on human insights into physics, future autonomous, cognitive robots need to be able to automatically generate models that are based on information which is extracted from the data streams accessible to the robot. In this paper, we survey the progress in model learning with a strong focus on robot control on a kinematic as well as dynamical level. Here, a model describes essential information about the behavior of the environment and the influence of an agent on this environment. In the context of model-based learning control, we view the model from three different perspectives. First, we need to study the different possible model learning architectures for robotics. Second, we discuss what kind of problems these architecture and the domain of robotics imply for the applicable learning methods. From this discussion, we deduce future directions of real-time learning algorithms. Third, we show where these scenarios have been used successfully in several case studies.},

On the basis of behavioral and computational evidence, this paper describes a formal approach to the representation and the mechanism of scene gist understanding, based on scene-centered, rather than object-centered primitives. We show that the structure of a scene image can be estimated by the mean of global image features, providing a statistical summary of the spatial layout properties (Spatial Envelope representation) of the scene. Global features are based on configurations of spatial scales and are estimated without invoking segmentation or grouping operations. The scene-centered approach is not an alternative to local image analysis but would serve as a feed-forward and parallel pathway of visual processing, able to quickly constrain local feature analysis and enhance object recognition in cluttered natural scenes.},

These cells can be used to construct retinotopic keypoint maps at different spatial scales (level-of-detail). The importance of the multi-scale keypoint representation is studied in this paper. It is shown that this representation provides very important information for object recognition and face detection. Different grouping operators can be used for object segregation and automatic scale selection. Saliency maps for focus-of-attention can be constructed. Such maps can be employed for face detection by grouping facial landmarks at eyes, nose and mouth. Although a face detector can be based on processing within area V1, it is argued that such an operator must be embedded into dorsal and ventral data streams, to and from higher cortical areas, for obtaining translation-, rotation- and scale-invariant detection.},

A two-level object categorization scenario is tested in which pre-categorization is based on coarse scales only and final categorization on coarse plus fine scales. We also present a multi-scale object and face recognition model. Processing schemes are discussed in the framework of a complete cortical architecture.

It is based on explicit multi-scale features: lines, edges and keypoints are extracted from responses of simple, complex and end-stopped cells in cortical area V1, and keypoints are used to construct saliency maps for Focus-of-Attention. The model is a functional but dichotomous one, because keypoints are employed to model the "where" data stream, with dynamic routing of features from V1 to higher areas to obtain translation, rotation and size invariance, whereas lines and edges are employed in the "what" stream for object categorization and recognition. Furthermore, both the "where" and "what" pathways are dynamic in that information at coarse scales is employed first, after which information at progressively finer scales is added in order to refine the processes, i.e., both the dynamic feature routing and the categorization level. The construction of group and object templates, which are thought to be available in the prefrontal cortex with "what" and "where" components in PF46d and PF46v, is also illustrated. The model was tested in the framework of an integrated and biologically plausible architecture.},

abstract = {Learning and generating serially ordered sequences of actions is a core component of cognition both in organisms and in artificial cognitive systems. When these systems are embodied and situated in partially unknown environments, specific constraints arise for any neural mechanism of sequence generation. In particular, sequential action must resist fluctuating sensory information and be capable of generating sequences in which the individual actions may vary unpredictably in duration. We provide a solution to this problem within the framework of Dynamic Field Theory by proposing an architecture in which dynamic neural networks create stable states at each stage of a sequence. These neural attractors are destabilized in a cascade of bifurcations triggered by a neural representation of a condition of satisfaction for each action. We implement the architecture on a robotic vehicle in a color search task, demonstrating both sequence learning and sequence generation on the basis of low-level sensory information.},

We demonstrate the strength of the approach on a range of recognition tasks: From invariant single object recognition in clutter to multiclass categorization problems and complex scene understanding tasks that rely on the recognition of both shape-based as well as texture-based objects. Given the biological constraints that the system had to satisfy, the approach performs surprisingly well: It has the capability of learning from only a few training examples and competes with state-of-the-art systems. We also discuss the existence of a universal, redundant dictionary of features that could handle the recognition of most object categories. In addition to its relevance for computer vision, the success of this approach suggests a plausibility proof for a class of feedforward models of object recognition in cortex.},

abstract = {Motor skill learning may involve training a neural system to automatically perform sequences of movements, with the training signals provided by a different system, used mainly during training to perform the movements, that operates under visual sensory guidance. We use a dynamical systems perspective to show how complex motor sequences could be learned by the automatic system. The network uses a continuous attractor network architecture to perform path integration on an efference copy of the motor signal to keep track of the current state, and selection of which motor cells to activate by a movement selector input where the selection depends on the current state being represented in the continuous attractor network. After training, the correct motor sequence may be selected automatically by a single movement selection signal. A feature of the model presented is the use of 'trace' learning rules which incorporate a form of temporal average of recent cell activity. This form of temporal learning underlies the ability of the networks to learn temporal sequences of behaviour. We show that the continuous attractor network models developed here are able to demonstrate the key features of motor function. That is, (i) the movement can occur at arbitrary speeds; (ii) the movement can occur with arbitrary force; (iii) the agent spends the same relative proportions of its time in each part of the motor sequence; (iv) the agent applies the same relative force in each part of the motor sequence; and (v) the actions always occur in the same sequence.},
